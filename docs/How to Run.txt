First, ensure the companion computer is set up with a Samba server and can be accessed from the ground station as 'X://'
Second, ensure that "X://" and src/Mission Data are empty on the Ground Station
Find the Addresses of the following connections: COMPANIONCOMPUTER, GROUNDSTATION, AUTOPILOT
Next, open an SSH or PuTTY connection from the Ground Station to the Companion Computer.
In the connection, use the command "screen -SL mavproxy" to open a new screen.
Start mavproxy: "mavproxy.py --master=AUTOPILOT --out=udp:GROUNDSTATION:14551 --out=0.0.0.0:1234"
In the mavproxy command, replace AUTOPILOT with the serial port, GROUNDSTATION with the IP address. The 0.0.0.0:1234 is used to communicate with the payload software.
On the Ground Station, open QGroundControl and connect to UDP port 14551.
On the SSH connection, use 'Ctrl-A + D' to detach from the mavproxy screen.
On the SSH connection, enter the command "screen -SL mission" to open the mission screen.
On the SSH connection, navigate to the src directory.
On the Ground Station Terminal, navigate to the src directory.
On the Ground Station Terminal, enter "python ground_station/main.py". This software will now wait for mission completion.
On the SSH connection, enter "python Payload/main.py". This software will wait for arm to take-off.
Once the mission is complete, make a copy of the contents of "X://" and delete all files in the drive.
