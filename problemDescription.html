	<p>
		In this project, a drone is tasked with flying over a full parking lot, and finding (and marking) an empty parking space. 
		The project goal is to locate 80% of the empty parking spaces. Further optimization includes finding all of the empty spaces. The
		parking spaces will be marked on a google map that can be accessible to the drivers on their phone or a display.<br/><br/>
		
		As a practical matter, we'll not be flying experimental drones over other people's cars. Instead, the drone will be scanning the 
		parking lot from outside the parking lot and instead of flying over the empty space (or spaces), it just reports it to the GCS (
		it's understood that it's trivial for the drone to fly over the empty parking space as soon as the latitude and longitude are 
		correctly computed). <br/><br/>
		
		This project is tested at the Spring Hill Park and Ride lot near NC State's Centennial Campus: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B046'27.2%22N+78%C2%B039'57.6%22W/@35.7742176,-78.6681917,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4e57ce5874e165f2!8m2!3d35.7742133!4d-78.666003">(35.77421327758554, -78.66600295798509)</a>
